# Sickchill

Homepage: [Sickchill](https://sickchill.github.io/)

SickChill is an automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows.
It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic: automatic torrent/nzb searching, downloading, and processing at the qualities you want.

## Usage

Set `sickchill_enabled: true` in your `/inventories/[my inventory]/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

The sickchill web interface can be found at `http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8081` by default
